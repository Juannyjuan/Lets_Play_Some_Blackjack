# BlackJack_Game

## Getting Started

This is still a work in progress. 
Essentially if you have a python console (spyder or vscode) you should be able to upload the BlackJack_Game file and run it.

There is only one module imported, that is the random module.

Still working on tailoring the codebase to test specific strategies in repeated games of blackjack and find out the player's winning probability.

Remember to replace placeholders like "your-username," "your-project," and "your_module" with the actual information for your project. Additionally, tailor the sections and content to fit the specific needs and characteristics of your project.
